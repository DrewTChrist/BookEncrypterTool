## Simple Instructions
1. Create a Magic Decoder Ring
   * You will be prompted to select a text file (.txt) that you will use as your book
2. Add a message to work with
   * You can start with a clear text messge or a cipher text message first it does not matter
   * You will be prompted to select a text file (.txt) that you will use as your message
   * Clear text messages must consist of words and numbers separated by single spaces
   * Cipher text messages must consist of numbers separated by single spaces
   * All text files used by the program will have punctuation and extra spaces removed so no need to do this prior
3. Encode or Decode your message
   * To encode a message it must be in the correct clear text format
   * To decode a message it must be in the correct cipher text format
   * If a word in the message is not contained in the book it will be encoded as a "-1"
4. Save your decrypted or encrypted text
   * You will be prompted to select a location to save the text file (.txt)
